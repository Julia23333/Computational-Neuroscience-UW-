function [ sta ] = compute_sta( stim, rho, num_timesteps )
%COMPUTE_STA Calculates the spike-triggered average for a neuron that
%            is driven by a stimulus defined in stim. The spike-
%            triggered average is computed over num_timesteps timesteps.
    sta = zeros(num_timesteps, 1);

    % This command finds the indices of all of the spikes that occur
    % after 300 ms into the recording.
    spike_times = find(rho(num_timesteps+1:end)) + num_timesteps;

    % Fill in this value. Note that you should not count spikes that occur
    % before 300 ms into the recording.
    num_spikes = size(spike_times,1);
